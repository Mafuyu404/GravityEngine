/**
 * Compile-only fixture for a fictitious external content mod.
 *
 * <p>This class exists to prove that a consumer can publish, sample and
 * inspect gravity through {@code cc.sighs.gravityengine.api...} alone. It is
 * never registered, never loaded and never executed; it only has to compile.
 * A real external mod would keep the same shape.</p>
 *
 * <p>One instance of this class represents one placed star-core block. It
 * owns at most one {@link FieldPublication} lease: it retains the lease after
 * publishing, replaces it only when a newer revision is accepted, and closes
 * the lease it owns when the block disappears. A stale or dropped handle can
 * therefore never remove a newer registration.</p>

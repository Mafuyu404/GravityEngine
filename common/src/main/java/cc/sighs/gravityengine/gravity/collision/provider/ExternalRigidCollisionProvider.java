/**
 * Engine-owned extension point for external moving collision geometry.

 * <p>A provider publishes immutable rigid-obstacle snapshots into an
 * engine-owned {@link RigidPublicationCollector}. The collector may be the
 * ordinary gameplay scene builder or a bounded collector used by a narrower
 * hot path such as packet occupancy validation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The provider must never assume that the collector is an unbounded
 * {@code CollisionSceneBuilder}. In particular, {@link
 * RigidPublicationCollector#addObstacle(DynamicCollisionObstacleSnapshot)}
 * may fail closed immediately when the owning operation exhausts its work
 * budget.</p>
 *
 * <p>The collector owns the captured snapshot lifetime. A provider must not
 * retain the collector or any mutable world handle through it after
 * {@link #capture(ExternalRigidCollisionQuery, RigidPublicationCollector)}
 * returns.</p>
 *
 * <p>Capture is spatial discovery. {@link #resolve} is identity reacquisition
 * for persistent support and must not require a broad world scan.</p>

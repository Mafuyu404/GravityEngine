 * <p>The live model contains only facts that are genuinely independent:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the assigned {@link GravityState} and its
 *   {@link GravityAuthorityMode};</li>
 *   <li>one tri-state {@link FieldPresence} for the current assignment
 *   ({@code UNKNOWN}/{@code PRESENT}/{@code ABSENT}); it is not applicable
 *   when the authority is not {@code FIELD}, and that is derived from the
 *   authority rather than stored as another state;</li>
 *   <li>one durable FIELD continuity bit; it distinguishes an ordinary
 *   default/absent FIELD state from a FIELD-derived durable seed whose numeric
 *   gravity may happen to equal vanilla/default gravity;</li>
 *   <li>the durable assignment revision, which orders durable persistence
 *   writes, and the live synchronization revision, which orders the live
 *   assignment stream;</li>
 *   <li>authoritative suppression and its influence revision;</li>
 *   <li>committed application and its application epoch;</li>
 *   <li>the load bootstrap flag and the latest desired pending target;</li>
 *   <li>remote snapshot acceptance initialization.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There is no second reconciliation state machine, no provisional-presence
 * flag and no synthetic entity-incarnation identity: those concepts either
 * restate {@code authority}/{@code fieldPresence}/{@code durableFieldContinuity}
 * or collide with the native Minecraft/NeoForge entity lifecycle.</p>
 *
 * <p>It deliberately owns no {@code Entity}, {@code Level}, {@code CompoundTag},
 * loader handle, logger or transport type. Persistence encoding, entity
 * identity, attachment lifecycle and diagnostics belong to the target adapter
 * that wraps this state.</p>
